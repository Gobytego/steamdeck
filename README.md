# steamdeck
a few of my scripts to make steamdeck more fun

"distrobox_helper" will setup a ubuntu container to allow you to install any software from the ubuntu repos.

"bu_steamdeck" is a fork of my backup utility for SolusOS wich is a fork of Joe Collins BU backup utility for debian/ubuntu and it allows you to backup your home folder to a backup USB drive.

"speedtest" will run a network speedtest.

"howold" will show you how long ago the OS was installed

"upd" kind of useless with steamdeck but it updates your flatpaks wich should automatically be done anyway, guess its a fun way to do it from the terminal.
